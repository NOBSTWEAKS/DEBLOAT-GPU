Uninstalling GPU Drivers: This process involves removing the current GPU drivers from your system. This can be done through the device manager or via the control panel. Simply find the GPU (NVIDIA, AMD, etc.), right-click, and select "Uninstall." This process will remove the software but may leave some remnants.

DDU (Display Driver Uninstaller): DDU is a more thorough, third-party tool designed to completely remove all traces of GPU drivers from your system. It's especially useful if you're facing issues like driver conflicts or wish to perform a clean installation of new drivers. DDU ensures that no leftover files, settings, or registry entries remain from the previous drivers.

Key Differences:
Uninstalling via Control Panel: Removes the driver but may leave behind remnants that can cause issues later.
DDU: Completely wipes out the drivers, providing a clean slate for new installations and can fix potential driver-related problems. It's more thorough but requires rebooting into safe mode for best results.
